There has been a TINY change here to make it use the Google Chrome browser by default, when you launch the Bwana.app and use its man page search tool.  It also uses Chrome when you do something like "open man:<whatever>" from the terminal, although typing "man:<whatevevr>" in the Chrome URL bar is currently not working (it asks to open Bwana.app, then does nothing).  If I keep working on it I'll modify it to use the default browser on the system, and fix the bug just mentioned in the chrome url bar.
